# Meditation-Lamp
A lamp that uses an EEG chip to scan your brainwaves to see if you're really relaxed and yells at you if you're not

This project was made possibly using the existing arduino brain library which can be found at https://github.com/kitschpatrol/Brain

And the visualing of the data can be found at https://github.com/kitschpatrol/BrainGrapher

What I added were the constrainst so that once the attention reached a certain threshold, something would happen and applying the correct logic so that it happened correctly 

To run this code, you must add the brain libray and download the processing code as well. 
Then, you will run the braingrapher.pde file that can be found in the "thing" folder...great naming I know. 

Also make sure to have the code uploaded to the arduino as well before attempting to run (the brainlamp.ino file).

If there are any questions, feel free to reach out to me at any time
